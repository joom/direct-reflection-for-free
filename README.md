# Direct Reflection for Free!

Documents (TeX, slides etc.) for the work on using `Data` and `Typeable` to get a direct reflection system for free, when we're implementing a toy language in Haskell. In other words, work about automatically deriving metaprogramming features from AST data types using Haskell's generic programming.
